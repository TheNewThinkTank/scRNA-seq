# DATA

There are several public databases and repositories where you can find high-quality open-source single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets. These datasets cover a wide range of tissues, cell types, organisms, and conditions, making them valuable resources for scRNA-seq analysis and research. Here are some popular sources:

1. **Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)**: GEO, hosted by the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI), is a widely used repository for gene expression data, including scRNA-seq. You can search for scRNA-seq datasets by using relevant keywords or browsing the available studies.
